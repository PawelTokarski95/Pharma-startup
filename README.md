# Pharma-startup

#A new potential startup would like to have some information about pharmaceutical market in order to be very functional and fluent. 
#In order to survive in their first years it gathered very useful data related to this topic. My role was to show everything in the good looking shape.

#The first assumption was to create a plot which could provide some insights about drugs needed for treatment the particular diseases - 
#the company would like to know which type of diseases are the most profitable for treatment.
#The second assumption was to check the volatility of the pharma index on US stock exchange in relation to SP500 and Euronext-
#this could explain if the whole pharma business is worth to engage and on which market (less volatile),
#based on standard deviations measurements.
